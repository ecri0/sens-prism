Notice

Business Source License 1.1

This Business Source License (this "License") between Licensor and you is not
an open source license. However, the Licensed Work will eventually be made
available under an open source License, as stated in this License.

License Grant. Licensor hereby grants you the right to use, modify, create
derivative works, and redistribute the Licensed Work, in source code or object
code form, subject to the Restrictions and conditions below.

Restrictions. You may not:
(a) sublicense, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of
    the Licensed Work as a whole, or allow others to do so;
(b) remove or obscure any licensor notices on the Licensed Work;
(c) use the Licensed Work for providing time-sharing services, service bureau
    services, software-as-a-service (SaaS) services, hosting services, managed
    services or any other form of commercial hosting or services that compete
    with Licensor's offerings; or
(d) alter, remove or obscure any proprietary notices (including patent,
    trademark and copyright notices) on the Licensed Work.

Conditions. In consideration of the grants of rights contained herein, your use
and redistribution of the Licensed Work is conditioned upon your compliance
with the following conditions:

(a) You must retain, in the source code or, if applicable, other forms in which
    the Licensed Work is made available, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Licensed Work, excluding those notices that do
    not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
(b) You must provide, with prominently displayed notice in the source code or,
    if applicable, other forms in which a Derivative Work or the Licensed Work
    is made available, a complete copy of this License and provide the
    Licensor's name and address with each copy you distribute.

Change License. Effective on the Change Date, or if earlier the date you create
a Derivative Work (any modification, enhancement or adaptation of the Licensed
Work), Licensor hereby grants you the right to use, modify, create derivative
works, and redistribute the Licensed Work under the Change License; provided,
however, that on such date the Licensor also grants to any recipients of
Derivative Works created by you the rights granted to you under the Change
License on an open source, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable basis.

For avoidance of doubt, and to clarify the scope of Change License grant:
should the Change License be the Apache License, Version 2.0, then the rights
granted to recipients of Derivative Works are those specified in Apache
License, Version 2.0; should the Change License be another open source license,
then the rights granted to recipients of Derivative Works are those specified
in the applicable Change License. Any Derivative Works for which you do not
retain such open source licenses may be made available under a separate
commercial license.

Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS,
DAMAGE, COST OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER RELATED TO THE LICENSE OR THE
USE OF THE LICENSED WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, COST OR EXPENSE. IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF
DOUBT, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, OR
LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

Patent License. Licensor hereby grants you a license under any patent claims
owned by Licensor that are necessarily infringed by your use of the Licensed
Work (as provided by the Licensed Work at the time Licensor made the Licensed
Work available), subject to the Restrictions and conditions of this License.

Patent Infringement. If you have knowledge that the Licensed Work infringes a
patent owned by you, you must notify Licensor in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable. If you fail to do so, Licensor may pursue all remedies available
at law or in equity.

Term. This License is effective until the earlier of:
(a) the date that this License is terminated, as provided below; or
(b) the date on which the Licensed Work is made available under an open source
    license, as described above (the "Term").

Termination. If you breach any of the conditions or restrictions in this
License, Licensor may terminate this License immediately upon written notice
to you. Upon any such termination, you must cease using the Licensed Work and
destroy all copies of the Licensed Work in your possession or control.

Entire Agreement. This License, together with the restrictions and conditions
of this License, constitutes the entire license agreement between Licensor and
you and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations,
understandings and communications, whether written or oral, between Licensor
and you relating to the subject matter of this License. There are no covenants,
conditions or other terms in this License which are in derogation of or in
addition to the terms of any other agreement between Licensor and you.

Governing Law. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, excluding
its conflicts of law provisions. Any action or proceeding arising out of this
License shall be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts located
in California, and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction
and venue of such courts.
